Pretty easy to stay longer though as it would be state troopers that ask you to move along, and they are few and far between. 

The Rest area has a paved ring road with parking spots under small trees, within short walking distance to picnic tables. As well, a large gravel area circles most of the paved road as well, so many large units can pull over. The west side of the Rest area also has some trees that one can pull their vehicle between to get more shade/ wind cover. Semi trailers have a separate lot to park in.

The washrooms are clean enough for a high traffic Rest area, but staff were there early cleaning up (so use the facilities after they clean). Garbages are all over the place, as are the shaded and non-shaded tables. No outside water source found, but there are vending machines on site. 

Good place, but It was a little loud. The trucks (of course) run all night and there is a train that passes the Rest area once every hour (at least). There must be an unmarked crossing on the tracks, as the trains blow their horn three or four times each time.

1823,"16680-18998 CO-96, Westcliffe, CO 81252, USA",Smith Creek Campground: Creekspots #2,Wild Camping,"This last weekend my girlfriend and I stayed for two nights within the first area of campsites just West of the initial RD 287 access point, a few yards from the creek itself.

I went a day early to scope out the area since I found bits and pieces of info online but nothing too detailed about this specific area. This campsite is all dispersed camping. Up RD287 (North) there are a few sites scattered on the left and right, the top-most being what looked like the biggest and most secluded, though it was taken when I saw it. The other spots seemed in rough shape but that could have been an illusion as I didn't actually get out to check any of these spots up this road. I considered these spots the official ""Smith Creek Campground"" as labeled on the map, and even though I'm sure the whole area uses this label, I'm gonna call this area SCC.

Almost directly across the street from SCC to the south (back on Highway 96), just to the west a few yards is an entrance to a couple sites on the creek side of the highway (I'll call these ""Creekspots #1""). But these camping areas seemed lived-in and definitely weren't being maintained or cleaned. It was sad, tbh. But I kept driving west, and not even a few hundred yards farther West from the Creekspots #1 entrance on 96 was another entrance with a sign that read ""Wanted: Your fire DEAD OUT"", and this one led to a number of sites. I'll call this area Creekspots #2.

The first couple camping areas in Creekspots #2 had nice parking and were easily accessible by car or truck. I parked here initially since I was in a Camry just scoping out the place. There was a road up which I eventually walked up that looked like it was better suited for trucks, jeeps, or brave car-drivers only. So I stayed parked near the entrance. A short walk had me to the creek and there were a couple spots to the left (East) and many more spots up to the right (West). The creek was audible from this entire area, btw. At the time, no spots were occupied, that I could tell. It was pretty clean and user-maintained too, especially after what I'd seen at Creekspots #1 and up SCC.

I walked near the creek and followed it up, between the creek and the road, and came across some 1 or 2 more 1-4 person areas. Up the little Creekspots #2 Rd just a walk was a bigger, open area that the road cut through. A few of the spots seemed to be taken over by ants but for the most part, the spots all seemed ready for easy camping. All the spots I saw had remnants of old campfires. The road kept going across the creek, accessible by braver people with 4WD to what looked like at least 1 more site, but it could have been dozens more for all I know; I didn't get a chance to get across, the water was running pretty good (mid-May).

There were a few more even farther west than the road went, where you can walk a trail that goes for maybe a hundred or so yards. It could have even gone further, but there was a point where I decided I wasn't going to lug my stuff any further since I wasn't preparing for a backpacking-style camping trip.

We came back the next day in a truck and I drove past the first couple obvious parking spots available right as you pull in to the second obvious parking spot that was a single spot, perfect for me to back up the truck. (Careful for big rocks in the ground)

We stayed here and it was beautiful. The creek is yards away, far enough to have to walk to it but close enough to always hear it steadily flowing. It's serenely peaceful in the morning, of course. I don't know what this place looks like once the camping season really gets started but our mid-May trip was fantastic and I'm excited to come back and try it again.

If you visit the spots based on my review, please just pick up after yourself. Good camping is only good camping if we work together to keep it that way.",38.17458,-105.15155,"(38.17458, -105.15155)","(-11705417.002123447, 4604117.55188147)",-11705417.002123447,4604117.55188147

Several level spots right beside or on the concrete launch pads or infront of the control bunker.

The paved access road is a bit rough. Big rigs should watch out for the washouts (can drive around).

If you keep driving about 300m further than the spot marked here, you'll come to a fantastic spot outside the fenced area. Incredible 360 degrees views from a ridge, level concrete pad, space to turn around your rig.

Disclaimer: I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

Shortly after leaving NM15, you enter a beautiful forest that has been totally devastated by fire, so it's extremely interesting to see. The road through it is an easy 2WD road with only a few very minor rockier sections. The forest fire area goes on for about 6km until you reach 2600m in altitude, that's where the trees come alive again. The views are stunning as this road gains altitude quickly through a canyon and from the top you can enjoy the entire fire area.

Some cautions: I would not recommend visiting here on a windy day. These trees still weigh a ton and are ready to topple over. Also, do NOT camp in the forest fire area.

There are plenty of spots to pull off the road and camp above 2600m.

4867,,Blue Island Avenue,Wild Camping,"This is a *free*, legal stretch of Chicago that works great for stealth camping.  Chicago requires permit parking almost everywhere that is residential and pay parking everywhere else, so stealth camping can be a real challenge.  The entire stretch of Blue Island from Ashland to Western is free parking and there is *plenty* of ample parking, with lots of large open spots. Where I have marked, there are green-space plantings and some open lots that are perfect for dumping pee without being a bad neighbor.  It’s very industrial on the south side of the street so there just isn’t much foot traffic or people to worry about.   Plus, it’s right on a bike lane, so if you have bikes, you can quickly plug into Chicago’s terrific bike infrastructure.  The CTA Pink Line El is just a few blocks north, which is a fast and easy way to get to the downtown.  There are also many bus routes in the area.

You can find water at any Chicago Park that has a field house, which are free to enter and use.  Some have showers and pools. Most parks also have drinking fountains that operate from spring-fall, but those are a PITA to use for filling water cans. Nearby parks:  Dvorak Park has a historic fieldhouse plus free outdoor swimming pool in the summer from Memorial Day to Labor Day.  Ping Tom Park in Chinatown is super cool.  There is a new fieldhouse/boat house that is free, with beatiful bathrooms, indoor swimming pool, and fitness center.  While Palmisano Park doesn’t have a fieldhouse or water options, it is worth a visit for stellar views of Chicago and a fascinating history (it used to be a quarry!).

I teach at a nearby high school and have spent several nights camping in my minivan for multiple days with no problems—even without moving the van.  (Note:  normally I take the train and bike commute from the suburbs, but there are times when it’s just too much of a pain due to needing to stay at work until 10 pm for special projects or due to coaching).  I have cooked on a camp stove more than once, in the open, with no one blinking an eyelash. 

Chicago moved it’s market district about 10 years ago to just a few blocks south on BI Ave due to gentrification and expansion of the University of IL-Chicago.  As a result, this street gets morning traffic, but is remarkably quiet at night.  It is well lit all night.  As a single female who bike commutes 95% of the time, at all hours, I have never felt in danger or worried here, but I consider myself to be pretty street smart. I don’t see much foot traffic along here other than some of my students going to school and an occasional person waiting for the bus.

Crime concerns:  I bike this route daily, and I teach at a high school for students that specializes in kids who are in gangs, so I know the ‘hood better than most.  When I spend the night, I put up blackout windows and I don’t leave anything of value visible.  I have seen some broken window glass farther south on Blue Island which usually indicates break ins.  And I see a LOT of graffiti tagging—but mostly on new gentrification digs or public ways.  I think if you left your van in the same place for a week, you might have problems.  If you are moving it every 2 days, even if its just half a block, I don’t think you would need to worry.

This is close to downtown, plus it’s in the Pilsen neighborhood, which just got voted one of the 10 best neighborhoods in the world.  There are tons of great food options within blocks, mostly Mexican but also some fusion and new American, mostly on 18th Street.  Check Yelp for ideas. I am addicted to Taqueria Tayahua on Western Ave, which has the best vegetarian quesadillas (on handmade tortillas!) in town.  I die for the Huitlacoche and Flor de calabaza quesas...  For vegans, the famous El Faro is about 1.5 miles away in the Little Village neighborhood.  I also love Sora Temakaria for unusual but delicious sushi options.

Locals sell excellent tamales & champurrado at the nearby Plaza Tenochtitlan in the mornings (and sometimes right on the corner of Cermak/Blue Island/Ashland) on all but the most glacial of days.  It’s a cheap and delicious breakfast. You can also find great summertime street food (fresh fruit cups, paletas (popsicles), etc.) on mobile carts around the neighborhood. Speaking of which, the paletas are terrific, in flavors like cinnamon and rice, coconut, fresh strawberry, mango, etc). 

This location is half a block away from an Aldi, so cheap supplies are at hand if you want to cook your own food.  There are many bodega style small vendors in the neighborhood as well.  If you want to go to a “real” grocery store, check out Pete’s Fresh Market on 18th St., just west of Western Ave. They have a fabulous produce department and a great prepared food area, including a banging salad bar.

Chicago’s excellent Chinatown is a straight shot down Cermak (22nd St), an easy bike ride due east. There are so many delicious restaurants here that I suggest you browse Yelp for specifics. The outdoor mall is pretty cool for strolling around in, but parking is a bear—and you want to pay to park in a nearby lot because of *very* tight free parking lots if you drive it. A bit farther north is the very hip Randolph Street food area, home to many Michelin starred and highly reviewed venues ($$$). There is also a great Greektown, just a half mile north on Halsted.  If you like fish, I can’t recommend Santorini enough.  Finally, little Italy is a bit north and East of here.  If it’s summer, it is well worth going to Taylor Street to get some homemade Italian Ice at Mario’s, and if you eat meat, check out the famous Italian beef at Al’s (although Al’s is open year round).",41.85103,-87.66924,"(41.85103, -87.66924)","(-9759295.15503329, 5138690.515175348)",-9759295.15503329,5138690.515175348

4880,,"Damien to Paulina (“Paw-LINE-uh”) along Walnut, etc",Wild Camping,"My family lives in suburban Chicago.  I bike commute to work each day, taking the train into the city, but biking at both ends of the commute for a total of 12 miles a day on bike.  I ride around the city all the time, and have for over 20 years, year round,  so I would consider myself a very knowledgeable local. I teach at a high school based on restorative justice that focuses on kids who have been out of school for while (mostly ex-offenders on gang or drug charges), located in the nearby Pilsen neighborhood.  I’ve learned a lot from working with them about safety in the city!

Chicago requires permits in nearly all neighborhoods and requires fees nearly everywhere else. You need to be very careful where you park or you WILL get ticketed (and possibly towed!!!), as the agency which tickets is private—not the police!  However, there is a stretch along Damen, particularly between Walnut, Fulton Market and Carroll, as well as along most of the side streets here that are free.  It’s urban and industrial,  home to metal fabricators, deliverly companies, art co-ops and food services.  Because this area is full of small businesses, including two fantastic coffee roasters (Intelligentsia and Metric) as well as numerous breweries (Great Central, Finch, Goose Island), vans and trucks are the norm here, so it is easy to blend in, even if you have windows, logos, and racks.

As in all of Chicago’s neighborhoods, streets are well lit.  This area feels pretty safe to us (suburbanites), but I wouldn’t advertise having valuables inside and I woudn’t leave attractive targets outside, unless they are well locked. 

There is traffic along Damen, but not obnoxiously so. You can take the nearby side streets to have a quieter experience. We have boondocked here twice, over the weekend in spring of 2018, and over Columbus Day (long) weekend in 2017.  Both times it was pretty sleepy as many of the businesses are closed on the weekends.  If you park closer to Paulina, you are close to the CTA el Green Line, which is an easy shot to downtown or other points around the city.  

Because the el is due south and there are train tracks due north, expect train noise during the night, although the Green Line does not run from midnight to 4 am.  It doesn’t bother my hubby and I, but then we live a half block away from a super busy frieght line, so trains barely register on our radar!

I like parking along Damen because there is a bike lane there, which we use to access much of the near north side.  Free parking is hard to find in Chicago, so I value this ‘hood as it allows us to spend time in the city without paying for a hotel.

You can find big parking spots without a problem. However, water and waste removal are going to be a challenge.  Skinner Park is nearby.  It has a small fieldhouse with toilets, but the park shares facilities with the nearby Whitney Young High School, one of the top high schools in the United States. You can use the indoor pool and showers there, which are open M-Sa from 7am-10 pm.  I’m not sure how access is affected during the school year though, so check before driving over.  Union Park is also nearby and has a great, vintage field house that includes a fitness center (about $20/month) and outdoor pool (free during open swim, no id required). There are showers and toilets.  The fieldhouse is open from about 10 am-7:30 pm. Smith Park is also nearby and has similar facilities (I am not familiar with this park, but it is close by and the CPD website says that the fieldhouse is open from 9:30 am to 7 pm.)

There are loads of great food and drink options nearby:
-Fulton Market is just a block north and you are surrounded by breweries and brew pubs.
-About 1 mile north are tons of restaurants, bars, and stores on Chicago Avenue, including the all vegan Upton’s Breakroom.

6586,,North Lemmon Lake WMA,Wild Camping,"North Lemmon Lake WMA offers free camping for up to 10 days. After 10 days you must leave the part for at least 24 hours, and take all property with you.

There is no drinking water, trashcans or restroom facilities here. Several tornado shelters are available in nearby Lemmon. You may call the police non-emergency number at 605-374-5651 for their locations.

The pinpoint on the map is the best site to camp. This pull-through is relatively private, wind-protected, and fairly parkable. Although the entire park is available for camping, certain parts on the south side of the lake are only accessible by boat or through private land. Additionally, motor vehicle access is not permitted past the signs. The north facing loop shown on the iOverlander map is only for park employees. No motor vehicles allowed on the north facing loop into the below-dam area or up on the butte north of the dam. However, there is a loop (allowed for motor vehicles) at the end of the road past the fishing and boat docks. If you park at the end of this loop, you can reach the other side of the lake by foot across the rocks.

Gas and groceries are available in nearby Lemmon, SD and Hettinger ND. (IGA groceries/gas/truckstop on the highway in Lemmon or Kennedy's in Hettinger, ND) Pay showers are available at the Geo's Corner gas station in the middle of town next to the Petrified Wood park. City park dumpsters are located at Hettinger Mirror Lake park and the park directly south of the Petrified Wood Park in Lemmon. Both parks offer free public electrical connections in the middle of the parks (for phones or grills, not accessible for RVs). The City of Lemmon offers a free RV sewage dump station on the north side of town near the railroad tracks. Although this station is intended to be used for those camping for free at the small north side park along the railroad tracks, campers at North Lemmon Lake may use it, too. Big rigs and combines are welcome at the park along the railroad tracks, and it is equipped with a trashcan and portable toilet, but no water.

Additionally, the Hugh Glass Campground (also free, about a half-hour to the south) has a dumpster only for campers, so if you keep your trash while on the move, you can get rid of it there.

The road directly north between Lemmon and North Lemmon lake is minimum maintenance for about 1.5 or so miles. If you are driving with an RV, you must go around to the west and north of the lake to avoid the minimum maintenance road. Additionally, there is a large dip the road leading up to the dam from the minimum maintenance road. Occasionally it is so wet you will get stuck if you attempt it.

North Lemmon Lake is patrolled occasionally by the ND Game & Fish and by the Adam's County Sheriff department. No glass containers or dumping.

Fishing is sometimes good here. People seek out this lake from as far as ~100 miles away. It is relatively clean for swimming or washing clothes and not overly populated with leaches or other biting pests. However, if you have an open cut, you will want to bandage so the leaches do not seek it out. On rare occasions, you may see a Bull snake (not venomous) or Rattlesnake (venomous), but they are tricky to tell apart.

Because of the buttes, cell service is not always available here.

The dumpground on nearby Dumpground Road does not accept ordinary garbage--only inert waste like construction debris.",46.01208,-102.16301999999999,"(46.01208, -102.16301999999999)","(-11372735.364303023, 5782285.260090699)",-11372735.364303023,5782285.260090699
6589,,"Forest Service, good dispersed campsite location",Wild Camping,"We camped here several times in 2018. This is good place to stay if you are exploring Rapid City. Free camping for up to 14 days.

Camping is prohibited off of Bogus Jim Road because it is not owned by the Forest Service. However, there is a small unofficial parking lot just off of Forest 202. It is large and flat enough for even big RVs. However, taking Nemo Road and Bogus Jim Road to get there may be a bit of a challenge.

There is a sign saying that you must have a permit to drive on the Forest Service road. However, I called the Forest Service, and they said you do not need a permit to park a little bit past the entrance of the road for camping. So this campsite is completely free.

Because this area is near buildings, hunting is prohibited, making this campsite safer.

Locals were friendly to us. 

Little traffic on the Forest Service Road-maybe one person a day, if that.

6715,,N Franklin Street,Wild Camping,"A truly amazing spot!

This is normal street parking. The best thing is, it is completely free and there are no restrictions whatsoever. I literally parked my car in the same spot for an entire week without moving once. I have a normal car converted into a sleeper van, so  it was kind of stelath camping, but you might be fine in a small RV as well.

I did not sleep every night in the car though, because the temperature was sometimes way below freezing temperature. But there is a nice little hostel around the corner so I switched between the places. They also feature a cafe with a very decent coffee, so perfect for starting the day after a cold night in the car and have a toilet break.

The location is very convenient, you can walk downton to the loop, there is a CTA trainstaion nearby to access the North, South and East of town easily. It cannot get any better :)

In terms of safety, the neighborhood is completely safe and I never felt uneasy.

The only drawback is the availability, I think it can get hard to find a spot, I regularly saw locals looking for a spot. Be aware that the street parking is not free or unrestricted on the whole street, just check the signs. If you go to my stated coordinates, you are completely fine.

We arrived from Portal direction, very late and opted for overflow parking for Herb Martyr walk-in camp (free). This overflow parking is designated also by Forest Service as dispersed camping spot (free..... bare bone). 

What this spot lack on esthetics, it compensates with a convenience of:
* Toilets (lower parking, 50meters)
* Good starting point for number of trails (some in the form of loops, ranging from easy walks to 10+mile hikes)

After approximately 0.9mile / 1.4km you will come to wider section of the road with very short ""driveway"" branching to the right, leading to a plato overlooking the valley. 

According to a map I have available, this spot seems to be right on the border line between Lake Mead National Recreation Area and BLM. 

I have opted for parking our camper van for a night on the wider part of the road as the plato was too windy and exposed.

One can also drive in further and park/camp pretty much anywhere, provided your vehicle is no more than 15 ft from a road and you're easily visible so you don't inadvertently get fired at.

8546,,Madrone Tree Hill,Informal Campsite,"Camp under the stars in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. (RV's/trailers - see below.) This 50 acre family-owned property is located in the heart of Apple Hill. There are two streams that run through it, with a hill that separates them. It is a working Christmas Trees farm that was started in the 1960's and now has many trees that are too big to fit in anyone's home, but provide an unbelievable canopy for some of our camp sites. Half the property is covered in a pine forest (with some secluded camp sites) with the balance being Christmas trees, Manzanita brush, Madrone trees, and open areas (for larger group campers). There are trails throughout the property for visitors to enjoy. There is an Apple Farm across the street that makes the best donuts in Apple Hill! Less than a mile away is a farm brewery and there are wineries throughout the area. There is also a large lake nearby that is a favorite for local kayak and canoe enthusiasts (and some who enjoy fishing) since most non-locals don't know it exists.   

Campsites 1 - 10 are centrally located at the top of the hill, sites 11 - 15 are more remote (& quieter) but are also farther from the bathrooms & potable water supplies.  (Site 15 is in a tight forest where slender pine trees rub against each other; if there's any wind, they make sounds akin to wooden ships rubbing up against the docks in a harbor.  NOTE: Sites 12 - 15 have been reorganized and their numbers changed to be in a logical sequence.  Therefore, past comments regarding these specific sites may no longer be accurate and could refer to a different site.  Please ask me if you have any questions.)   If you are traveling in a group, we suggest getting two sites next to each other rather than trying to squeeze everyone into a single site - it's actually less expensive to rent two sites with 5 people each rather than putting 10 people into a single site.  

RV's & TRAILER's- Please note, there are currently only a few furnished campsites that can accommodate these - sites 3, 4, 8, 11 and site 12.  Please let me know how large an RV/trailer you have so that we can make sure that we can get you to fit.  Please note, there NO HOOKUPS.  However, potable water is accessible when you arrive - please bring a long hose to make filling easier.   

CAMPFIRE NOTE: Fire pits with a grill & mesh cover are provided at every site.  All fires must be contained in the fire pit.  Open campfires (on the ground) are prohibited.  Please keep the fire pit covered when in use and always fully extinguish your fire when you leave the campsite.   You may collect dead wood to burn from the property, but please bring a handsaw to cut up pieces so they will fit into the fire pit.",38.74872,-120.68352,"(38.74872, -120.68352)","(-13434427.993539847, 4685741.517594715)",-13434427.993539847,4685741.517594715

There are no bathrooms or water, but there are (filthy) bathrooms down the road at Johnson Park.  This place was really clean with lots of garbage bins.  
   No one came by to bother us, I think discreet campers and RVs alike can park here without issue.  The boat launch might be a better place for RVs because there is much more space.  Also, there's a RV park at this location too, if you need to plug in.  We saw electrical plugs by the boat launch but didn't use them.  Not sure if they are in operation.

    There is a small rock fire pit and nothing else.  There are pit toilets at the Picketwire Corrals at the North West corner of the Comanche National Grasslands (in which the site is located).  Also, if you're entering from the north west corner, before turning right to continue down to this spot, if you stay left, you will hit a trailhead down into the canyon.

A few had some serious tire ruts (indicating that it might get REALLY muddy here after a rain), but we were able to avoid the ruts easily, and only slowed down for a few cattle guards.

8750,,Campsites on the road past Cottonwood Lake,Wild Camping,"Several dispersed campsites are located on both sides of the FS road #344.  We stayed at a large treed campsite past the paid campground on Cottonwood Lake.  It was super quiet and really dark here, of course.  We had a really great sleep.  There was someone camping at a site nearby, but he was by himself and quiet.
If you arrive early, hang around the lake for a bit.  Near the wildlife observation area just before the campground we saw a huge, white, furry mountain goat.  He was close and hung around grazing so we got a good look at him.  
At our site, there are no toilets or other facilities (of course), but you could go back to the campground or day use area and use their pit toilets if going deep into the woods isn't your style.  This place is beautiful, please help to keep it that way.  Pack out all your trash and toilet paper, and do your business far away from the site, making sure to bury it deep.

To get here:
Heading north through Buena Vista, we turned left on the 306 (Main St) and followed that road past the drive in theatre on the left and into the San Isabel National Forest.  Take a left turn onto the 343 (about a km into the NF boundary.  The 343 will eventually connect with the 344 and you should see signs for Cottonwood Lake Day Area and Campground. 
 We initially were going to stay in the day area (we pulled in close to 6pm), but we decided to keep driving into the mountains.  Drive past the first several private properties and cabins, you'll see a nice spot on the left but it is bordered with a nice wood fence.  Drive past that, there are several spots with firepits, and we picked a wide sloping spot on the right with a large stone firepit.  We were able to find a flat spot for the van.  In the morning, we saw some people driving out from further down the road, so I suspect that there are sites available deeper in.  As for large RVs, I think the road in should be ok for a small A-class or some mid-sized C-class rigs, but some turns are a bit tight, and some sites are rather small, suitable for tents or van sized rigs.

8751,,Delaney Butte Lakes Wildlife Area - FREE,Wild Camping,"Many dispersed camp spots along a dirt road around a cluster of three lakes.  The entrance (these GPS coordinates) is at South Delaney Lake, but there are two others that you can camp beside.  Several pit toilets are scattered around the lakes, and many people come here to fish.  We saw a sign that indicated no overnight camping, but there were several campers along the lake shore.  The beauty of this spot is that the sites are widely spaced, so even though there were many people around, we felt alone.  
The site is in a wide valley between two epic mountain ranges and had foothills surrounding them.  Very cool scenery, and if you like to fish or hike there's plenty to do.
   Nearby, to the north, there is also John Lake, which has a resort on one side.  We didn't go there, but it is also a state wildlife area, so I assume it has similar facilities.  There is a sign on the road in (county road 18) that indicates the turn towards John Lake.
    The road in, which turns off of HWY 14 also has several state wildlife areas, along streams or little lakes, but it was so muddy when we were in the area that the whole parking space was under water, so we kept going to Delaney.  At a dryer time, these spots would also be awesome.

We drove about 2kms up the road, but eventually there were no more campsites and the road began to get really rough (although doable with a high clearance 2wd).
  We back tracked and parked in a wide clearing with two fire pits on the North side of the road (on your right if you're coming from HWY 21).  The spot is only about 600 meters from 21, but you can't hear any traffic.
   As for a view, there's not much other than swaying pines, but it was a really nice large open space.  You can see a range of mountains through the pines way off to the North East.  No one came by.
   There is a TON of fire wood here.  We arrived to several chopped logs, but there's also a lot of kindling scattered around.  You will not need to search very far for it.  Also, the wood here was super dry, perfect for fires.
   A word of warning: if you're here in early June, bring bug spray.  The mosquitoes were pretty persistent.",44.330002,-115.11251200000001,"(44.330002, -115.11251200000001)","(-12814266.219774593, 5516653.587730655)",-12814266.219774593,5516653.587730655

There was a metal fire pit with a cooking rack, and we were able to scrounge some nearby wood.  The hills around are quite picturesque.

As a word of caution, this is a creekbed. It is completely dry right now even though it rained a bit yesterday. I'm no geologist but I suppose a flash flood here is possible if a catastrophic storm developed further up the canyon so be mindful of that if you're camping here in bad weather.

The turn off is between mile marker 49 and 50. At the brown wooden sign you can go right or left. The left track is very rocky with lots of ruts - best for a high clearance 4WD. We only saw a few small turnouts that seemed mostly like a place to turn your vehicle around. 
The right track has many places to camp, and is more accessible with a 2WD vehicle. There are still some rocks and ruts further in, but as long as you take it slow it should be fine. RVs up to 30 feet can most likely fit - definitely the spots at the very entrance.

Everyone including security was very friendly. We didn’t have to give our names, ID or License plate numbers - very informal. 
Said a few nights were ok as long as we didn’t stay for a week. 

We were the only overnighters in a  huge lot. The lot is slightly sloped and there is full sun, no shade. Large enough for big rigs and plenty of rigs - at least in the off season.

Shasta, 100km to the north, and a short hike along the Pacific Crest Trail (which is mere meters from this spot) offers views of West Prospect Peak.

After about 6-700 meters you will see a rarely used road/trail leading off to the left.  That road (not on Google maps) will take you to this spot.   You can hear the cars on the highway in the distance below, but it's not busy at night.  We slept great.
   You can hike the Pacific Crest Trail for miles and loop back to the spot via the Forest Service Roads that network through the area.

You have to drive 6 km Gravelroud to the Visitor Center. It is not necessary to have 4x4. Before that there are places in Wildlife Refugium, but most of them have loose gravel and are by the way. But if you continue to this point from us (see Google Maps) you can turn right (it's not an entrance but you can see much more solid gravel). There are already some fire places. We drove still few meters purely until we have found a straight place beautiful for us. One can stand there very well and has his rest, since it is a little offside of the way, nevertheless, one still sees the way. From time to time then vehicles came, which drove the way, however, did not come to us. Super place, except the few vehicles quiet, no big starry sky because one sees Las Vegas lights, nevertheless, again beautiful sunsets :-)
Recommendable, don't forget to take your garbage with you and buy water before :-)

12813,,Wash Creek disbursed camping,Wild Camping,"This is campsite 7/8 on the Wash  Creek dispersed camping forest service road. There are about 10 dispersed campsites on this road. Most are not suitable for full Overlander rigs, as they are tent platforms back in the woods or down an embankment from the main road. The parking spots are, in most cases on this road, simple parallel parking pull-off‘s. So not suitable for fold-out trailers or fold-out truck top tents. We travel in a smaller hard-side, non-slide truck camper, and find that this site and the one across the road from us are fine for what our needs are. We were here last night and made a note on a previous general note about this area. But this one is about this campsite specifically. The parking spot we’re in actually is shared for two tent platforms. There is a warning sign in each of the campsites along this road that the forest service is considering closing all of these campsites because of trash left behind. So, to help out a little bit we cleaned the trash from a number of sites this morning. There wasn’t a tremendous amount of trash but enough to be bothersome to anyone who respects the LNT ethic. It’s one of those “broken window” rules where a little bit of trash usually begets a cavalier irresponsible attitude about leaving other trash. Do the right thing and clean up after yourself and perhaps clean up a little bit after others. We always do. Leave no trace, leave it better than you found it.
Previous posters about this area have described accessing it from the Blue Ridge Parkway which was gated closed where we tried to access it near Asheville. So, Last night we came up over the Bent creek road underneath the Blue Ridge Parkway.. 12‘8“ clearance.. and down the wash Creek Road to find the site. Tonight we got here with much less back-road driving by entering from the downhill side at the North Mill River Campground area. The road is fine in both directions however.

As you drive west there are many flat-ish places to pull off and camp.  We arrived late after the sun had set, so we didn't go too far from the highway, but you can drive for miles away from the 160, all the way to Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge if you're feeling adventurous.  To the point where we stopped, 4 wheel drive is not necessary.
   Although we could see the highway from where we camped, the noise was negligible.  Only the odd semi using it's engine breaks could be heard, but even then, it was a quiet rumble from where we were.  Nice views of the mountains, good stars if the moon is small, very nice place for the night.

13851,,100 Mile Views,Wild Camping,"Numerous dispersed national forest campsites along the Mogollon Rim with fantastic 100-mile views of the valley and mountain ranges beyond.  Requires semi-dry conditions, not accessible during winter.  (We were there in late March and it’s 2WD with normal passenger vehicle clearance, Class B/C RV accessible.)

Take Young Highway south from Highway 260, then take the 3rd dirt road right.  There is a sign for FR campsites - the area is undeveloped camping. The first hundred feet have some larger puddles if there has been any rain, but the ground is firm and rocky underneath, any passenger vehicle, trailer, or Class B/C RV can get through unless the whole road is muddy.  Dirt road beyond the initial large dispersed camping area is mostly smooth but hazardous when muddy.

Go past the very large area for dispersed camping surrounded by forest - this is your last resort if other sites are taken.  The first option with views will be on your left about 1/4 mile down; look for the large pile of rocks for the fire ring.  This spot has merely ‘terrific’ views and is accessible to 2WD in semidry conditions.  We stopped here in our 24’ Class C due to the mud puddles beyond.

The sites with 100-mile views start about 1/8 mile further, on the left past the 3 large mud puddles (if there has been any rain).  I saw at least 4 sites.  The first is a left turn 4WD road for the last 50 feet.  The 2nd-4th are more easily seen because of the rock-pile fire rings. Some are accessible to 2WD if it’s dry.  I’d take my 24’ Class C down that road if dry, but you will need pickup truck clearance for the later sites. Longer Class C might bottom out if you go too far.

13873,,"Below North Twin ""River""",Wild Camping,"This is a boondocking site on Forest Service land, about 100 meters below North Twin ""River"" (which is actually a small creek). This site has big views over the Smoky Valley and it's above the treeline so there are some junipers. 

The road in, as of 4/1/20, is excellent up to the national Forest boundary, after which it degrades a little bit is still doable with any car that has reasonable clearance. I had no problem with my 2WD Sprinter, but I'm not sure I'd try it on my Prius. The road is narrow and there are very few places to turn around. 

Expect to do some leveling at the site, because the ground is not level. 

I had very intermittent text and/or ""emergency call only"" ability via Verizon, so don't expect your phone to work here. 

There is a sign just above the site that suggests no stock trailers further up, so be aware this may be used as a staging point at times. I also suspect this area is popular in the summer to escape the heat of lower elevations, and maybe for some fishing? 

About 100 meters past this site is a fork in the road. A sharp left (downhill) leads to a smaller site alongside the creek. 

Don't continue straight/uphill further from that fork unless you have a shorter, narrower vehicle as the road narrows and there are low-hanging branches. If you're in a high clearance car and/or tent camping, there is at least one more creekside site up that way, and probably more if you keep going. 

Happy camping!

Me and another guy I met here, both stayed here for the first time, both in RTT's, both unsure if it was OK or not, lol. I asked a local and she said people stay here all the time, and another one said she has been seeing more people camping like us since the quarantine started. 

BTW, Google maps will try to take you by Mystic Hot Springs entrance but it is closed due to COVID-19, I found an entrance through a neighborhood backstreet just to the left. You'll see it on the satellite map.

Fine when dry weather but the dirt road might need 4WD if it’s raining as some parts are red soil and some potholes (that you can avoid if driving carefully).
