This project stems out of my interest and interest of many outdoor enthusiasts to find amazing 
and undiscovered areas to go camping.  There are several resources currently to locate interesting 
campsites, but they depend on user entered campsite information and curation.

What if we could scan satellite imagery and predict where good campsites will be?
  
I believe the techniques used here can be utilized for other purposes but initially the focus will 
be on using machine learning techniques with known campsites to characterize the satellite features 
of “good” campsites.  In addition, the slope, road access, proximity to buildings and other factors 
like is it located on public land (National Forest vs BLM land – which have different regulations) 
can be used to deliver the best undiscovered campsites to users.  Initially this project will use data 
available from the ioverlander mobile app to train and validate predictions.
