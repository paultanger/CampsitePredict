This project stems out of my interest and interest of many outdoor enthusiasts to find amazing and undiscovered areas to go camping.  There are several resources currently to locate interesting campsites, but they depend on users entering campsite information.  What if we could scan satellite imagery and predict where good campsites will be?  I believe the techniques used here can be utilized for other purposes but initially the focus will be on using machine learning techniques with known campsites to characterize the satellite features of “good” campsites.  In addition, the slope, road access, proximity to buildings and other factors like is it located on public land (National Forest vs BLM land – which have different regulations) can be used to deliver the best undiscovered campsites to users.  Initially this project will use data available from the ioverlander mobile app to train and validate predictions.  The predictions will implemented in tensorflow on satellite image tiles from google earth engine API (my access is pending) or other satellite image sources such as EObrowser.
